                <p> Web design is an art form that influences how users interact with the internet. Whether you're designing a personal blog or a large e-commerce site, the choices you make in color, typography, and layout affect the user experience. Design allows us to express our thoughts, values, and creativity.People can judge how you will treat them by looking at your website. Your design gives them insight as to how you view your audience. If you don’t put any effort into your website’s design, your audience knows that you won’t put effort into helping them.</p>

                    Your website is like a customer service representative. If your website is bright, modern, and inviting, your audience will feel more welcome on your page. You’ll give the impression that you are open and welcoming to new people who visit your website.</p>
